# REST Diagnostic

This file is a markdown file. Markdown is a special way of formatting text, and one that's used by GitHub in its README files.

### Question 1

In your own words, define what REST is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

I know your not looking for are 10 min brakes.
The .liquid stuff is REST. Taking html and showing it differently based on values sent it.

```

### Question 2

Imagine you are designing an API that will deal with a resource called
`movies`, what would the appropriate RESTful routes be for sending requests to
that API? Please list the path next to the HTTP verb it would be associated
with.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
I don't understnd this question. I know what a path is, but the http verb?
```

## Question 3

What are some of the benefits of using an architectural style like REST when
developing an API? When might you NOT want to use the RESTful style?

My plan was read through this week class notes on the site. Guess I'll be looking for the answer when I do.
